## SDLC Workflow

**Trigger:** When the user sends an **idea**, **feature request**, or **requirement**, run the full pipeline continuously through deployment. Do not stop after one phase unless the user asks.

**Memory requirement:** Before executing any new action, recall relevant memories (project context, user preferences, past decisions) to ensure continuity and avoid repeating mistakes.

**Parallel by default, sequential only when required.**

1. **Phase 1** [PO] — PRD, user stories, feasibility → docs/sdlc/po/{epic-slug}/
2. **Phase 2** [BA] — FRS, NFR, Gherkin, process flows → docs/sdlc/ba/business/{epic-slug}/
3. **Phase 3** [UX] (if app/web) — Design specs + wireframes; [PO]+[BA] review until approved → docs/sdlc/design/{epic-slug}/
4. **Phase 4** [SA] — ADRs, C4 diagrams, security by design → docs/sdlc/architecture/
5. **Phase 5** Technical [BA] — API specs (OpenAPI 3.x), team breakdown → docs/sdlc/ba/technical/
6. **⚡ Phase 5a** [QE] + **⚡ Phase 5b** [DEV] — parallel after Technical BA
7. **⚡ Phase 8** [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] — parallel audits after [DEV] complete → merge gate
8. **Phase 9** [OPS] — Docker Compose + K8s + IaC → docs/sdlc/deploy/
9. **Phase 10** — SHIPPED ✅
10. **Phase 11** Maintenance — monitoring, bug fixes, patches

Design before Architect (UX drives tech). After Technical BA, [DEV] runs immediately — parallel with [QE] docs. See docs/sdlc/agents/
